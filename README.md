  ## Description
  Have all your notes stored locally in a easy to use webpage! With this application you can store, delete and add as many notes as you would like! With a very easy to use UI this will make taking notes so much easier than it has before! 

  ## Installation
  Once you have cloned the repo you will need to run 'npm i' in the terminal to install the necessary packages. From there run 'node index.js' to launch the application. This will run on port 3001 in your browser. 

  ## Usage
  The UI is designed to be very easy to use. In the upper right hand side you can create a new note. On the left you can see all your stored notes and delete any that you may wish. If you click on an exisiting note it will open the contents of it so you can go back and see what you have entered.
